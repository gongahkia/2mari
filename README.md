## Why?

I previously built a similar project called [`Keep talking bro`](https://github.com/gongahkia/the-sandbox/tree/main/javascript/keepTalkingBro) in 2023 that added filler words to provided text.   

Since then *(and having entered University)*, I wondered if it would be possible to achieve the opposite, a TTS service that simplified verbose text.

## Reference

The name `2mari` is in reference to the Japanese expression „Å§„Åæ„Çä (tsumari), which roughly translates to "in other words" in English.
